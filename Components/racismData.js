    title: 'Individual Racism',
    text: "Individual racism refers to an individual's racist assumptions, beliefs or behaviours and is a form of racial discrimination that stems from conscious and unconscious, personal prejudice.” Some may argue that their statements and ideas are not racist because they are simply “personal opinion”. However it is important to note that individual racism is directly informed and reinforced by systemic racism. This means that no individual act of racism exists without context or hierarchies of power. Examples of individual racism are telling a racist joke, acts of violence motivated by racist beliefs and believing in the superiority of white people.",

    title: 'Systemic Racism',
    text: 'Systemic Racism refers to the policies and practices entrenched in established institutions that harm certain racial groups and help others. The word ‘systemic’ distinguishes this from acts of individual racism and refers to the way racism operates in major parts of society, such as the economy, education and public policy. Examples of systemic racism include the disparaging wealth gap between black and white South Africans and unequal access to healthcare among racial groups.',

    title: 'Internalised Racism',
    text: 'When people targeted by racism come to believe the racist beliefs and stereotypes about them and see the racist policies and practices harming them as valid. They may act out this belief by opressing others of their own group or by devaluing themselves with feelings of shame, self-hatred, isolation, powerlessness, self-doubt and despair. An example of internalised racism is the privileging of lighter skinned-people over darker-skinned people.',
